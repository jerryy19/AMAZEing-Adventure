CS576 Game Programming Project @UMass Amherst


## Game Description
The purpose of this game is to find a way out of the map but the puzzles need
to be solved before leaving the level. There will be obstacles in the level, such as
areas where they slow you down and enemies trying to prevent you from succeeding. 
This game is built using Unity. 

## What are you trying to teach through this game (Educational Component)?
The target audience is elementary school students who are looking to practice their
vocabulary and improve their spatial memory. 

## 3D world and characters
Our world will be procedurally generated. Becuase our world is procedurally generated, 
we have infinite levels. Each level is a closed environment and the game will be played 
in 3rd person.

## Game mechanics
The player will walk through the level and solve all the puzzles, taking advantage of 
the environment provided and avoiding obstacles. 

## Animation
All animations will be keyframe animated.

## User interface and sound
